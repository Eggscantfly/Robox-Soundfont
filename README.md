# Robox-Soundfont
This soundfont was made from the data from the .wt (WaveTable) file paired along with the .pcm (Raw Wave Audio)

# Usage
Place `build_soundfont.py` in the same directory as `robox.wt` and `robox.pcm` (or in a parent directory), then run`build_soundfont.py`  
The script will search its own directory and subdirectories for the files. If they can't be found, a file explorer dialog will open to select them manually.


# Shoutouts
Thank you Santiago for my insperation on making this!
